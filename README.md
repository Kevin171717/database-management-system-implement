# Data Manipulation Tool

This Python tool provides a convenient interface for performing various data manipulation operations on CSV files. It leverages the pandas library to handle and manipulate data efficiently, offering functionalities such as set operations (union, intersection, difference), Cartesian product, projection, selection, and renaming of columns.

## Features

- **Load Data**: Load CSV files into the program to create datasets that can be manipulated.
- **Select Based on Condition**: Perform selections on datasets based on specific conditions.
- **Project Columns**: Extract specific columns from a dataset.
- **Rename Columns**: Change the names of the columns in a dataset.
- **Cartesian Product**: Combine two datasets into one by forming the Cartesian product.
- **Set Operations**: Perform union, intersection, and difference operations on the data from two datasets.
- **Save Results**: Ability to save the results of operations as new datasets for further manipulation.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Tool**: Run the tool by executing the script. This will initiate the user interface in the command line.
2. **Loading Data**: Begin by loading CSV files. You will be prompted to input the file path of the CSV file you wish to load.
3. **Performing Operations**: Follow the on-screen instructions to select the operation you wish to perform. You may need to specify additional details based on the operation selected, such as column names or conditions.
4. **Viewing and Saving Results**: After an operation, view the results directly in the console. You have the option to save the result as a new dataset within the tool for further manipulation.
5. **Exiting the Tool**: You can exit the tool at any time by selecting the option to exit.

## Dependencies

- pandas: The tool uses pandas for data manipulation and operations. Ensure pandas is installed in your Python environment.

## Installation

Before running this tool, make sure you have Python and pandas installed. You can install pandas using pip if you haven't already:

```
pip install pandas
```

## Usage Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the tool:

1. Load a CSV file by selecting option `0` and entering the file path.
2. Perform a selection operation by choosing option `1` and specifying a condition, such as `'column_name > value'`.
3. Save the result of the operation if desired.
4. Continue performing other operations or exit the tool.

## Note

This tool is designed for educational and simple data manipulation tasks. For more complex data analysis or manipulation needs, consider using pandas directly with more custom scripts or applications.
